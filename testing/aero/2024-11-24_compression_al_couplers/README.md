# Notes from 2024-11-24_compression_al_couplers

- Tested both Prometheus aluminum couplers in compression
- Force was transfered from one side of the load cell through blue tube, then through the ledge that sticks out from the coupler's main cylindrical body, and then through blue tube again to the other side of the load cell
- The vast majority of the strain was due to the blue tube straining, so that data won't tell you about the couplers (and don't try to back-calculate that out from the data, as the blue tube wasn't cut that well, was quite uneven, and for the second loading slipped off the coupler). As such, the data itself isn't much use beyond saying the max load they took
- Neither coupler sustained any visible damage
- First coupler loading was manually stopped at 2500 N, as we expect flight loads to be well under that
- Second loading was stopped when edge of the blue tube slipped around part of the coupler. Coupler took 1700 N before the test was stopped. We expect that to be significantly less than the upper coupler will sustain in flight
