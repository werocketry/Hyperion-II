This is where our OpenRocket simulations go. The `.py` scripts leverage [orlab](https://github.com/CameronBrooks11/orlab) to run OpenRocket via Python. Doing this allows us to build and test our rocket using the OpenRocket application GUI, then use code to automate and enhance the analysis.

By scripting with `orlab`, we can:

- Run simulations programmatically, enabling batch testing and parameter sweeps.
- Extract detailed flight data and events for further processing.
- Generate custom plots and outputs that are not natively available in OpenRocket.
- Integrate OpenRocket data into larger workflows or other engineering tools.

The `outputs` folder contains images and text files generated by the scripts, including:

- Flight performance plots such as thrust, velocity, and altitude over time.
- Key metrics like rail exit velocity, average descent velocities, and ground impact conditions.
- Summarized event logs detailing critical moments in the flight, such as apogee, recovery deployments, and ground hit.

This approach ensures that we can efficiently analyze and refine our rocket designs while keeping a comprehensive record of simulation results for future reference.
